<h1>Titlu de nivel 1</h1>
<h2>Titlu de nivel 2</h2>
<p>
Different properties take values of different types. Length is one of the most common
types; it’s made up of a number and a unit, but if the number is zero, the unit be omitted. Percentage values are relative to some
aspect of the document or display, and you need to look at the definition of each property to see how,
if at all, percentages apply.
All keywords within the control of CSS are case insensitive, but other values may
be case sensitive, depending on the markup language and the operating system of
the web server. A CSS parser should ignore the invalid or unsupported parts of a
style sheet.
